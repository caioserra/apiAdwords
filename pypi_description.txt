libraries. If you would like to obtain example code for any of the included
client libraries, you can find it on our
`downloads page <https://github.com/googleads/googleads-python-lib/releases>`_.

Known Issues
============

* The installation of PyXML and cElementTree will fail on Ubuntu 13.04. If you
  are trying to install adspygoogle on Ubuntu 13.04, you should avoid installing
  these dependencies. If you need to use either of these dependencies, there is
  a work-around that can be found in
  `this bug <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python2.7/+bug/1238244/>`_.
  Another alternative is to install manually and exclude these dependencies. To
  do so, first download and extract the tarball below. In the root directory,
  run the following command::

  $ sudo python setup.py install --no_PyXML --no_cElementTree
